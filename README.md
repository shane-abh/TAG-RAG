# Budget 2025 Navigator 🍁

An intelligent chat application that helps users explore and understand Canada's Budget 2025. Users can ask questions about government policies, tax changes, investments, and economic projections, and receive detailed, source-backed answers in real-time.

## What This Project Does

This is a **chat-based web application** that makes complex government budget information easy to understand. Think of it like a smart assistant that can answer questions about Canada's fiscal policies by searching through official documents and providing clear explanations.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can have natural conversations about budget topics
- **Real-time Responses**: Answers stream in as they're generated, providing immediate feedback
- **Source Citations**: Every answer includes references to the original government documents
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system
- **Query Optimization**: The system automatically improves user questions to find better answers
- **Usage Tracking**: Visual indicators show how many questions remain in a session

## Technologies Used
